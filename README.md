# LoRaWAN Handover Roaming 
LoRaWAN Handover Roaming is novel LoRaWAN roaming scheme to enable inter-operatorroaming based on DNS resolution and end-device context migration between networks. In this work, Our contributions are threefold :

* Design and implementation of a LoRaWAN architecture extension to handle inter-operators roaming capability.
* End-devices lookup DNS-based resolution using JoinEUI codification.
* Real Deployment roaming testbed

# LoRaWAN Architecture Extension
We extended the LoRaWAN standard architedture with two main components as illustrated in the following figure.

* Master Agent (MA) : The MA is a core component that plays an intermediary role between several independent LoRaWAN networks  owned by different operators.
* Local Agent (LA) : The LA is a local component connected to the Network Server

In More detail, each component is composed of serveral sub-components as described in the following figure.

# Experimental Setup
To validate the designed solution for LoRaWAN handover roaming , we implemented and deployed a testbed based on [ChirpStack](https://www.chirpstack.io/)
